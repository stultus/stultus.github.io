      <description>I recently installed linux mint 14 (Nadia) in my office laptop (HP Notebook 450 ). after installation when I booted into the os , the screen brightness was set very very low which I was able to adjust using the brightness function key. Later I had the same problem when Ubuntu 12.10 was installed on the same laptop. So here is a permanent fix for the issue.
 Current brightness value is stored in /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness file.</description>
