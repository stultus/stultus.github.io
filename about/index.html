    <p>I currently work as the VP of Engineering in Kochi based ed-tech startup <a href="https://entri.me">Entri</a></p>
<p>As the VP of Engineering at Entri, I lead a team of developers in driving innovation within the education industry. With over 6.5 years of experience in this role, I have developed core competencies in strategy, software engineering, and product management, delivering solutions that enhance learning outcomes and accessibility.</p>
<p>Besides my professional pursuits, I am a technology enthusiast, privacy advocate, Pythonista, and free software enthusiast. Most of my contributions have been in the language computing space under the aegis of the organization <a href="https://smc.org.in">Swathanthra Malayalam Computing</a>, where I have gained expertise in language computing and free software development. Through this initiative, I have collaborated with various communities and government agencies, such as Mozilla, Wikimedia, KITE, SCERT, and ICFOSS, to promote open source technologies and digital literacy. Additionally, I am involved in the <a href="https://pearsearch.org">PeARS Project</a>, a groundbreaking initiative to build a decentralized, peer-to-peer search engine that respects user privacy and autonomy.</p>
<p>I am passionate about sharing knowledge and insights through college sessions and TV discussions, covering topics such as the latest technological advancements and their societal impact. I also enjoy exploring my creative side and was privileged to write the additional screenplay for the 2023 Malayalam movie &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neelavelicham_(film)">Neelavelicham</a>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I was one of the key architects of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/InternationalChaluUnion/">ICU movement</a>, a socio cultural expression platform of the youth in my state.</p>
<p>Apart from the above mentioned projects, I have contributed to a number of free and open source projects &amp; movements and my relavant profiles are linked below.</p>
