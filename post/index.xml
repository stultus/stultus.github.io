      <description>Recently I had an opportunity to be a part of an effort to enable SCERT(The Govt. organization which is responsible for the content, curriculum and the textbooks which are used in the schools of the state) to use unicode technologies for textbook publishing.

      <description>I recently installed linux mint 14 (Nadia) in my office laptop (HP Notebook 450 ). after installation when I booted into the os , the screen brightness was set very very low which I was able to adjust using the brightness function key. Later I had the same problem when Ubuntu 12.10 was installed on the same laptop. So here is a permanent fix for the issue.
 Current brightness value is stored in /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness file.</description>
